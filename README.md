# DataView Pagination Helper

The DataView Pagination helper extends the `DataView Array Controller Behavior` included with the [DataView Helper](https://github.com/trevordevore/levurehelper-dataview) to support the display of paginated results. Pages of results are often returned by APIs that may potentially return large amounts of data. That data must be requested in pages so the data will not all be available when the DataView is asked to display the first page of results.
